        <h3>Website Creation</h3>
        <p>
          Many independent bloggers are not knowledgeable in website creation.
          Often, they use template-based website creators such as WordPress,
          WebFlow or Wix. These website creators are key to enabling those that
          aren’t skilled at web development to be able to pursue their ambitions
          independently, and work through drag and drop layouts that write code
          dynamically. One can then host a website and begin blogging.
        </p>
        <h3>Blogging vs Journalism</h3>
        <p>
          Two popular forms of online communication are blogging and journalism.
          It is difficult to understand what separates them. Often, they can be
          found in the same place. However, each form has their own tone and
          content. News sections written by journalists tend to be on the
          shorter side, with official, factual and serious sounding information.
          Journalists appeal to facts and collect their content in person. Also,
          it is much more viable to make a salary as a journalist. Bloggers
          appeal to emotion and make subjective, opinionated content from the
          comfort of their own home.

        <h2>What Are Blogs?</h2>
        <p>
          Oxford’s definition of blog is ‘a regularly updated website or web
          page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is
          written in an informal or conversational style.’
        </p>
        <p>
          They are a form of mass communication, opinionated speech and a place
          for groups of enthusiasts can share ideas and talk. There can be
          blogging businesses, individual blogs, or smaller businesses, for
          profit, or unmonetized, however, they all share some fundamental
          purposes. To align with an audience, to gain a following, to generate
          organic traffic through their website, and potentially even to call to
          action. Many larger businesses use blogging to find customers, build a
          brand, or build authority, but blogs can be less formal; a passion
          project.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the characteristics of blogs include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Displayed in reverse chronological order. From newest to oldest
            posts.
          </li>
          <li>Archives of old posts.</li>
          <li>
            Comments where people can communicate with each other and the blog
            poster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Side bars with social media profiles, popular content or calls to
            action.
          </li>
          <li>Links to find more about the author’s story.</li>

        <h2>History and Popular Blogs</h2>
        <p>
          Blogs are a form of online expression and have been utilised since
          1994. In the early days of blogging, one would blog as a sort of
          personal diary. However, they have been developed into versatile,
          monetizable and massive online journals and informational websites.
          These blogs can be run by inspired and dedicated individuals, or run
          by organisations, generating value by maintaining relevance to today’s
          society and building loyal consumers.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some popular US blogs:</p>
        <table id="blogtable">
          <tr>
            <th>Blog</th>
            <th>Year Started</th>
            <th>Estimated Monthly Visitors</th>
            <th>Estimated Monthly Revenue</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Huffington Post</td>
            <td>2005</td>
            <td>116,000,000</td>
            <td>$14,000,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>TMZ</td>
            <td>2005</td>
            <td>30,000,000</td>
            <td>$300,000</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Business Insider</td>
            <td>2005</td>
            <td>25,000,000</td>
            <td>$400,000</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Evidently, blogs can be extremely influential in today’s society. Most
          people might recognise these big names.

        <h2>The Future of Blogs</h2>
        <p>
          The future of blogging is something hotly debated in the blogging
          community. Its relevance peaked from 2005-2008, however, on the
          surface blogging seems to be a declining mode of communication. Some
          of the reasons for this estimate that interest in blogging is
          declining is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            More need for quality content due to google SEO ranking and people
            become choosier.
          </li>
          <li>Alternative sources of content consumption such as vlogging.</li>
          <li>
            Google knowledge graph, the program that returns the information you
            searched for to the top of your screen, is taking organic traffic
            from websites.
          </li>
